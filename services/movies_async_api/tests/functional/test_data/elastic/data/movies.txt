Initially saddened when he is fired from his job as a bagger at a supermarket, he eventually sees it as a sign that he is destined for greatness in some other field. Based on some information he learns, Bucky believes that destiny is to become a porn star, despite he being a virgin and only having recently learned what masturbation is. With his parents' blessing, Bucky hops on a bus to Los Angeles to make it big there as a porn star. He is taken under the wings of a few people in LA. On the professional side, he meets the reigning king of porn, Dick Shadow, who only sees in Bucky a laughing stock. But washed up porn director Miles Deep stumbles across what he sees as an untapped niche market for Bucky's limited talents. Miles has the challenge of trying to convince investors who only see in Bucky the antithesis of porn. On the personal side, Bucky befriends a young diner waitress Kathy McGee, who helps Bucky find a place to live - albeit with an insensitive oaf named Gary who only wants to get into Kathy's pants - and navigate general life in the big city. Kathy, however, is facing her own demons in working toward her destiny, those demons which Bucky hopes he can help her beat down.","creation_date":null,"genre":[{"id":"86d64c62-926b-4f13-9b27-933342ddb94c","name":"Comedy"}],"actors":[{"id":"f10c2122-19fc-48b5-aea0-d51f4fb9f097","name":"Nick Swardson"},{"id":"d5e64548-06bf-41a9-abe1-1ea233227139","name":"Christina Ricci"},{"id":"7aa61ec4-177e-462a-ac23-c40d09b0126c","name":"Don Johnson"},{"id":"48492353-89fc-4d52-bd04-49f870051b2c","name":"Stephen Dorff"}],"writers":[{"id":"3467c474-4648-45b7-98d2-f0d9da685223","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"id":"0f248858-077e-4861-a62c-b0ba98b1d2e8","name":"Allen Covert"},{"id":"f10c2122-19fc-48b5-aea0-d51f4fb9f097","name":"Nick Swardson"}],"directors":[{"id":"9827f085-57fc-4a72-9e8e-f4abde75abf3","name":"Tom Brady"}]}

Tall, fashionable, popular airhead big sister is dating him, but fails to truly appreciate the young gentleman, let alone contemplate a serious relationship. Nerdy kid sister Haley hates the waste and expresses her envy by thoughtlessly wishing at a 'shooting star' (comet) to be Alexia. To their stupor, that happens the next morning. Forced to live each-other's lives, but unable to do it well by the other's standards, the sisters soon hate each-other even more and deliberately screw up. Gradually, they realize they would only both lose out, learn to appreciate the other's values and reconsider their own. Remain the matters of obviously utterly confused Kyle, and new neighbor boy Simon, whose no longer secret crush on Haley was confounded by Alexia.","creation_date":null,"genre":[{"id":"7b635d57-f8b4-435c-912c-af33bafe84be","name":"Fantasy"},{"id":"f66ed250-4019-429e-bd9e-c58550169d5f","name":"Family"},{"id":"86d64c62-926b-4f13-9b27-933342ddb94c","name":"Comedy"}],"actors":[{"id":"1e3a2254-3939-4d06-a04d-563af9b468e3","name":"Katherine Heigl"},{"id":"781c9ad9-da20-4bc9-ac72-b08cbf290de5","name":"Danielle Harris"},{"id":"17c5878e-f5e2-475f-a66c-01877a09239d","name":"Donnie Jeffcoat"},{"id":"f2427807-9dbe-42bf-940c-21a5db981d95","name":"Scott Wilkinson"}],"writers":[{"id":"359745ac-da9e-4a76-a391-32cc7cdbdc8f","name":"Jessica Barondes"}],"directors":[{"id":"47f6347e-c1ec-4363-8d32-10666e1eaabe","name":"Blair Treu"}]}

Paul believes Dorothy is Playboy material, the magazine he sees as only a springboard to bigger and better things. Paul's dream does become a reality: not only does Dorothy eventually marry him, she becomes the August 1979 Playboy Playmate and ultimately Playboy Playmate of 1979, which does indeed lead to the start of an acting career. As Dorothy's star rises, Paul's life is one of a hanger-on as those in Dorothy's new circle, including Playboy publisher Hugh M. Hefner and movie director Aram Nicholas, don't much like Paul.

Her life is in shambles. She clings to the hope of resurrecting her past movie stardom as a leading ing√©nue. No one will hire her, she's penniless with creditors selling off anything that she owns that is of monetary value, and she has no one to turn to that can see her through financially. She has in the past supported her sister and brother-in-law, who still want to use her as their meal ticket.
